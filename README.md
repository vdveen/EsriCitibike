Citibike Data Visualizer
========

WIP. Project of mine to get familiar with Python and to compete in the
ESRI Young Scholars competition.  

I aim to visualize the Citibike open usage data in interesting
ways using Python and Arcpy.

Input is raw Citibike data, in csv format. Output is >500 frames
that I can put into video editing software.
